# Reporting Vulnerabilities

**⚠️ Please do not file public GitHub issues for security
vulnerabilities as they are open for everyone to see! ⚠️**

We encourage responsible disclosure practices for security vulnerabilities.

If you believe you've found a security-related bug, drop an email to our
[aio-libs security] mailbox instead of filing a ticket or posting to _any_
public groups. It is currently set up to forward every incoming letter to
both [Andrew Svetlov] and [Sviatoslav Sydorenko]. You can choose to email
us directly as well. We will try to assess the problem in timely manner
and disclose it in a responsible way.

[aio-libs security]: mailto:security@aio-libs.org
[Andrew Svetlov]: mailto:andrew.svetlov+aio-libs-security@gmail.com
[Sviatoslav Sydorenko]: mailto:wk+aio-libs-security@sydorenko.org.ua
