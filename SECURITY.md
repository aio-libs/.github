# Reporting Vulnerabilities

**⚠️ Please do not file public GitHub issues for security
vulnerabilities as they are open for everyone to see! ⚠️**

We encourage responsible disclosure practices for security
vulnerabilities.


## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you've found a security-related bug, fill out a new
vulnerability report via GitHub directly. To do so, follow these instructions:
1. Click on the `Security` tab in the project repository.
2. Click the green `Report a vulnerability` button at the top right corner.
3. Fill in the form as accurately as you can, including as many details as
   possible.
4. Click the green `Submit report` button at the bottom.


## Don't have a GitHub account?

Alternatively, drop an email to our [aio-libs security] mailbox instead of
filing a ticket or posting to _any_ public groups. It is currently set up to
forward every incoming letter to [Andrew Svetlov], [Sam Bull] and [Sviatoslav
Sydorenko]. You can choose to email us directly as well. We will try to assess
the problem in timely manner and disclose it in a responsible way.
